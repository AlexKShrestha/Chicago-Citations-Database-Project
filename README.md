# Chicago-Citations-Database-Project

My final group project using MySQL to clean up data from an existing Chicago Citations database to create and populate a new database. I helped forward engineer an EER diagram, helped cleaned up and imported CSVs into the new database, and helped wrote queries to answer specific questions on the original database.
